# ics-111-presentation-2
Presentation 2 for HCC ICS 111 M&amp;W class, primarily for groups 1 &amp; 2.

<h1>Topic 1</h1>
<p>Members: Anti (anti@hawaii.edu) and Nicolas (nsomera8@hawaii.edu)</p>
<p>  Create a Circle class to define circle objects. A circle has a
center and a radius. Use the Point class to define the center of the
circle. Your class must contain two constructors â€“ one without
arguments and the other with two arguments. The constructor without
arguments will create a default circle with radius 5 and center
(0,0). The constructor with arguments will create a circle with
custom radius and center as specified by the arguments. Your class
must also include a toString() method to give a string representation
for your circle.
Create a main class to test your circle class. Create a default
circle and another circle with radius 10 and center (5,0). Print both
circles.</p>

<h1>Topic 2</h1>
<p> Members: Bryson (blutao68@hawaii.edu) and Jake (jakedp@hawaii.edu) </p>
<p> Topic: Work with group 1 to enhance the circle class. You will add
getArea() and getPerimeter() methods to compute the area and
perimeter of the circle respectively. Test both methods in the main
class for different circles and display the results.</p>
